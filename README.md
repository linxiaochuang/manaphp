ManaPHP Framework
=================

Thank you for choosing ManaPHP - a high-performance [component-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering) PHP framework.

What is ManaPHP?
----------------

ManaPHP makes thorough use of [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection)
assisted by an application [inversion of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) container,
which allows for great flexibility, easy testing, and better architecture.

ManaPHP inherits the main spirit behind [Phalcon](https://phalconphp.com/), [Zend Framework 2](http://framework.zend.com/), [Yii 2](http://www.yiiframework.com/) for being simple, fast and highly extensible.

Requirements
------------

ManaPHP is only supported on PHP 5.4 and up. ManaPHP has been tested with Apache HTTP server on Windows and Linux operating systems.

Installation
------------

The best way to install ManaPHP is to download the ManaPHP from [github](https://github.com/manaphp).
